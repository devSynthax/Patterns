# Array Interview Questions — Pattern Wise Roadmap

This guide lists the most commonly asked **array interview problems**, arranged level-by-level based on patterns used in coding interviews.  
The goal is to build **pattern recognition**, not memorize isolated problems.

---

## 🟢 Level 1 — Fundamentals (Must Know Basics)

These test indexing, traversal, and simple logic.

- Find maximum / minimum in array  
- Reverse an array (in-place vs extra space)  
- Check if array is sorted  
- Count frequency of elements  
- Find second largest element  
- Remove duplicates from sorted array  
- Rotate array by k positions  
- Move zeros to end  
- Merge two sorted arrays  

**Pattern learned:** Traversal + in-place modification

---

## 🟡 Level 2 — Hashing & Prefix Concepts

These test use of maps/sets and counting logic.

- Two Sum  
- Find duplicate number  
- Find missing number (0…n or 1…n)  
- Intersection of two arrays  
- Longest consecutive sequence  
- Subarray with given sum  
- Count subarrays with sum = k  
- Majority element (> n/2 times)

**Pattern learned:** Hash map + prefix sum thinking

---

## 🟠 Level 3 — Two Pointer / Sliding Window

One of the most frequently asked patterns.

- Remove duplicates (two pointer)  
- Container with most water  
- Trapping rain water  
- Pair with given sum in sorted array  
- Longest substring without repeating characters  
- Maximum sum subarray of size k  
- Minimum window substring  
- Longest subarray with sum ≤ k  

**Pattern learned:** Two pointers + sliding window expansion/shrinking

---

## 🔴 Level 4 — Kadane & Subarray Optimization

These test optimizing brute force \(O(n²)\) to \(O(n)\).

- Maximum subarray sum (Kadane’s algorithm)  
- Maximum product subarray  
- Maximum circular subarray sum  
- Best time to buy and sell stock (all variations)  
- Maximum sum rectangle in matrix  

**Pattern learned:** Dynamic running state optimization

---

## 🔵 Level 5 — Sorting + Greedy + Partitioning

Common FAANG interview focus area.

- Sort colors (Dutch national flag problem)  
- Kth largest element  
- Merge intervals  
- Insert interval  
- Non-overlapping intervals  
- Meeting rooms / minimum platforms  

**Pattern learned:** Partition logic + greedy decision making

---

## 🟣 Level 6 — Binary Search on Arrays

High-value interview pattern.

- Binary search basic  
- Search in rotated sorted array  
- Find peak element  
- Find first/last occurrence  
- Median of two sorted arrays  
- Allocate books / shipping capacity  
- Aggressive cows problem  

**Pattern learned:** Binary search on answer space

---

## ⚫ Level 7 — Advanced / Hard Interview Patterns

These combine multiple ideas.

- Subarray sum divisible by k  
- Count inversions in array  
- Maximum XOR pair  
- Sliding window maximum  
- Median in data stream  
- Longest increasing subsequence \(O(n log n)\)  
- Split array largest sum  

**Pattern learned:** Hybrid logic + data structures + mathematical insight

---

## ⭐ Recommended Interview Preparation Order

Most companies expect this progression:

1. Traversal & in-place modification  
2. Hashing problems  
3. Two pointer + sliding window  
4. Kadane style optimizations  
5. Binary search on answer  
6. Greedy + interval problems  

Mastering these patterns enables you to solve **80–90% of array interview questions**.
