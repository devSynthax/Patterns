# Sliding Window Problems — Beginner to Advanced

A curated list of sliding window problems organized by difficulty level. Useful for interview prep, DSA practice, and pattern mastery.

## 🟢 Beginner Level

1. Maximum sum subarray of size K
2. Average of all subarrays of size K
3. First negative number in every window of size K
4. Count occurrences of anagrams in a string (Hold)
5. Maximum number of vowels in substring of size K

---

## 🟡 Easy to Medium Level

6. Longest substring without repeating characters
7. Smallest subarray with sum greater than or equal to K (Hold)
8. Longest substring with at most K distinct characters (Hold)
9. Permutation in string (Hold)
10. Longest subarray of ones after replacing at most K zeros (Hold)

---

## 🟠 Medium Level

11. Fruit Into Baskets (Hold)
12. Binary subarrays with sum K (Hold)
13. Subarrays with K distinct integers (Hold)
14. Longest repeating character replacement (Hold)
15. Count number of nice subarrays (Hold)

---

## 🔴 Medium to Hard Level

16. Minimum window substring (Hold)
17. Sliding window maximum using deque (Hold)
18. Substring with concatenation of all words (Hold)
19. Minimum window subsequence (Hold)
20. Longest substring with exactly K distinct characters (Hold)

## 📌 Notes

* These problems collectively cover **fixed window**, **variable window**, **frequency map**, and **two-pointer optimizations**.
* Recommended approach:

  1. Start with fixed-size window problems.
  2. Move to dynamic window resizing.
  3. Practice frequency-based window constraints.
  4. Finish with multi-condition windows.
